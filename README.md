Sahaay - Charity-portal
As a part of our college project, we made a portal where donators and the needy can come together. 
In this portal donators post the details of the item they want to donate. When someone who wants to take help arrives at our site, they can search for the item in the search box and a list of people who want to donate the same item will appear to them. From there they can contact the donator. Similarly, the donators can look at the list of things people want around them, and they can donate the item to the person they want.
